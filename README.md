# Sherry
The official isolatedYeti discord bot. Made with Node. Why use Sherry over any other discord bot? It has the full functionality of any discord bot you would want, but all in one place, and more! 

### How do I add the bot to my server?
Follow this link https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=715099531552751646&permissions=8&scope=bot, select the server that you wish to add Sherry to, (make sure you select administrator privillages or the bot won't work) and that's it! Once Sherry is in your server, type (with no quotation marks) ".ping", and Sherry will give you instructions on how to use her (if she's alive of course!).
